# CP1404/CP5632 Practicals

This repository contains instructions and code for practicals for the subjects CP1404/CP5632 at James Cook
University.  
Instructions are found in each prac folder.  
Some code files contain `# TODO` comments, which are part of the instructions for what students need to do.

## Practical Content

and if you're really keen, here's another practical that we used to have in the subject, focused on using the os
(operating system) module:

* [Practical - OS](./prac_os)

## Practical Marking

Assessment is based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section. You will be marked as follows:

- **4** = Excellent response to all questions (Always aim for this!)
- **3** = Good response to most or all questions, but some omissions or problems
- **2** = Reasonable response to some questions, but some significant omissions or problems
- **1** = Reasonable response to at least one question
- **0** = Minimal or no attempt
- **LATE** practicals will receive 1 mark for decent work, or 0 marks for poor work. Do not be late.

**Note**: This subject focuses on learning best practices and patterns for solving problems using programming in
Python.  
It is important that you learn these foundations according to the teaching philosophy of the
subject. So, to help you learn well, you will not achieve full marks for working/complete practicals
that are not done in the way that we teach.

Here are some reasons that you might lose marks for your practicals (and assignments):

- You miss or skip part of a question (you must attempt all requirements for all questions)
- Your work looks too similar to any provided solutions
- Your work does not follow the core concepts and patterns (e.g., using global variables, while True loops or similar
  techniques), even if they work
- You submit your work incorrectly (e.g., missing, misnamed files, incorrect URLs)

## Submission

Each prac includes a "Deliverables" section that tells you what to submit.

- Most pracs require you to submit one or more GitHub URLs.  
  Please type the URL/s of your GitHub practicals repository or PRs at the
  top of the text box when you submit your practical on LearnJCU.
    - Your PR URL will look something like: `https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/cp1404practicals/pull/1`
    - Your code review URLs will be very similar but with the other student's repo. The link should take us directly to
      the PR where you have done a good review
- You always need to upload/attach your files in LearnJCU.
- Please attach each file separately.
- Do not zip up your files.
- Ensure each file has the correct/exact name, including the extension.
- Ensure your code is not commented-out (only comments should be commented).
- Include a `# comment` for any parts of questions. E.g., if a question has parts `a.` and `b.` then add comments
  like `# a.` and `# b.` to make it clear where your answers are, and to show you what you need to complete.
- Rewrite any `# TODO` comments as appropriate.

## Solutions

Selected (not all) practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn by evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical problems.

**Important**: Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools... _after_ you complete
your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own coding.
