Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
- the estimation and the actual time I took is usually about within 15 minutes with some tasks taking further than 20 minutes of the estimation.

Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- Giving code reviews for those who have mentioned me in their requests always give me insights and new ideas of how code variation can differ but still function the same.
- Being reviewed from those who I have mentions them in request, give me new aspects of how flaws my code were in others eyes.

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
- Nothing really.
